# ML Project for Molecular Solubility Prediction

## Overview

This ML Project is designed to predict the solubility of molecules, a crucial piece of information for chemists and biologists. This machine learning model utilizes a unique dataset that includes various molecular properties to determine whether a molecule is soluble in water or different solvents.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading:** The process begins by loading the solubility dataset, which includes molecular descriptors necessary for solubility prediction.
- **Data Preparation:** Here, the dataset is prepared for modeling. This includes separating the data into features (x) and the target variable (y), followed by splitting into training and test sets.
- **Model Building:**
  - *Linear Regression:* A basic model to establish a baseline for prediction accuracy.
  - *Random Forest:* A more complex model expected to capture non-linear relationships better.
- **Model Evaluation:** Both models are evaluated based on their performance metrics, such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-squared values.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualization of prediction results to compare the actual solubility values with the predicted ones.

## Setup Instructions

- **Environment Setup:** Have a Python environment with necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib installed.
- **Data:** The dataset should be placed in a known directory. Update the data loading section of the notebook if your dataset path differs from the default.
- **Running the Notebook:** Open the delaney_project.ipynb in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

# Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Open the Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook delaney_project.ipynb
```
